# TWIST Web Project

Nathan Whoolery's cloned TWIST project.


This Github repository will contain all of the files necessary to build/run the TWIST website including both the database and the user interface.



## Running the Project Locally


Here is what you will need to do:

- Install node.js
- Install git (not GitHub)
- Install Visual Studio Code (not Visual Studio)
- Download files from GitHub or sign into GitHub using VS Code to clone the files


1. Click on 'Terminal' tab in VS Code and click 'New Terminal'
2. In the terminal window/pane type 'npm install'


Now whenever you want to test out the project, simply type 'nodemon' into the terminal window. You can view the website by putting 'localhost:3000' into your web browsers address bar.
